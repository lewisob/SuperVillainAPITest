# API test project for Covid-19 game

A small and basic REST Assured test framework for the Super Villain API

## Prerequisites
* Install Java 1.8
* Install Maven

## How to run tests

```bash
mvn clean test
```
Or run from [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/lewisob/SuperVillainAPITest)

## Test results
The project would benefit from a nice html report.
For now the results are printed in console or can be found in a simple text file at `/target/surefire-reports/CovidUsersTest.txt`.

The CircleCI results are sent to the #circle-ci channel in this [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/lewis-test-group/shared_invite/zt-i4wg3c7o-Y7e7JnYayBDJBaQA8tpg~Q)
